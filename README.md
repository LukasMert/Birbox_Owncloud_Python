# BirdBox

The aim of this project is to observe birds in a bird's nest. This is done by a camera module.
they are recorded and stored on an external data storage. You can also read this data on your PC using owncloud. When a bird enters, it will be detected and the camera will film for 5 minutes if it is still present after this, it will film again for 5 minutes.
